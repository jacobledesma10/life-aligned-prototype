**A Life-Aligned, Nervous-System-Inspired AI Prototype**

This repository contains an MVP implementation of a **regenerative, life-aligned AI system** inspired by biological nervous systems. The architecture uses:

• Organic data ingestion (soil/environmental CSV data)  
• A dynamic “perception” layer (reservoir / neural encoding)  
• Internal state + memory  
• Reinforcement Learning (RL) for adaptive behavior  
• Action-potential–style decision gating  
• A closed-loop feedback system  
• Life-aligned reward shaping  

The goal is not to optimize a single metric, but to **maintain system health, resilience, and regeneration** while minimizing existential and systemic risk.

This mirrors biological nervous systems:
• Signals accumulate  
• Thresholds determine firing  
• Actions are gated  
• Feedback updates future behavior

### 🔬 Design Principles

This system is built around:

• **Life alignment** – optimize for system health, not growth  
• **Thresholded action** – no automatic execution without gating  
• **Feedback-driven learning** – outcomes shape future behavior  
• **Risk containment** – dangerous actions are penalized or blocked  
• **Regenerative logic** – repair > exploit > replace

## 🧩 Planned Upgrades

1. Plug in **real USDA / ISRIC soil datasets**  
2. Add **risk-aware reward shaping**  
3. Add **dashboard plots for system health & firing events**  
4. Add **memory-augmented RL (recurrent PPO / LSTM)**  
5. Add **human + ecological oversight layer**
